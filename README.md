Project Description:

High-Altitude Balloon Measurement System

The High-Altitude Balloon Measurement System project focuses on creating a robust measurement system for a stratospheric balloon. This system incorporates libraries to parse data received via UART from GPS modules (specifically Neo7m sensors), as well as measure voltage and current using ACS712 sensors. Additionally, the project involves generating PWM signals for servo motor control.
