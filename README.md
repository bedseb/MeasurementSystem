Project Description:

High-Altitude Balloon Measurement System

The High-Altitude Balloon Measurement System project focuses on creating a robust measurement system for a stratospheric balloon. This system incorporates libraries to parse data received via UART from GPS modules (specifically Neo7m sensors), as well as measure voltage and current using ACS712 sensors. Additionally, the project involves generating PWM signals for servo motor control.

Key Components:

GPS Data Parsing:
The system includes libraries to efficiently parse data from GPS modules transmitted through UART communication. By utilizing Neo7m sensors, the project ensures accurate and reliable reception of location and timing data, crucial for tracking the balloon's position during its stratospheric journey.

Voltage and Current Measurement:
Integrated ACS712 sensors enable the measurement of voltage and current. This feature provides valuable insights into the electrical parameters of the system, ensuring optimal performance and safety throughout the mission.

PWM Signal Generation:
The project involves the generation of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals. These signals are utilized for controlling servo motors, allowing precise adjustments and movements based on the received data. This capability is essential for tasks such as adjusting the orientation of attached instruments or stabilizing the payload during the balloon's flight.
